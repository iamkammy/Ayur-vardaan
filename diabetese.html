                    <p>
                        Once presumed to be the “Rich Man’s Disease”, diabetes mellitus is now been seen as an epidemic amongst the urban poor in rich cities. The same is evident from a recent study done by the ‘Indian Council of Medical Research’ (ICMR), across fifteen states in India. To summarize, higher the GDP of the state, the greater are the chances of the ‘Disorder’.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 12px;">
                        The situation is not that simple as it might look like. India is the second country in the world with the most adults living with Diabetes. The figure in millions is 69.2, just after China which is at 109.2million.
                    </p>
                    <p>The very fact that there are around 10.3% of the Indian population with ‘Pre-Diabetes’, also known as “impaired glucose tolerance”, makes the scenario more frightening. The chance of this population to suffer from Diabetes is 1.4times higher than people who have diabetes. Around 47.3% of the 69.2million diabetics are undiagnosed and there is a high percentage that they might suffer from blindness, kidney failure, heart diseases, and stroke and foot amputation due to this untreated condition. No doubt, you may call Diabetes in India as a “SILENT KILLER”!</p>

                        <p>It is a kind of ‘Metabolic Disorder’ in which the blood has high sugar levels for prolonged periods. This will lead to symptoms like frequent urination, thirst, and hunger. If left untreated this may lead to serious complications like- cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers and serious damage to eyes.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>You must learn about the terms and things below to understand DM in a better way.</p>
                        <p><strong>- Glucose : </strong>  It is the basic building block of all carbohydrates and is the main energy source for all living organisms. They have a lower tendency to react with amine groups of proteins. This is called- glycation. Glycation either impairs or destroys the protein structure. When you eat something it is broken down into glucose and then the glucose is used to release energy. Excess glucose is stored by various metabolic activities, in the body. </p>
                        <p><strong>-   Pancreas and Pancreatic islets :</strong> Pancreas is one of the ‘Vital Organs’ of our body and is located in the abdomen. It helps in the digestion of the food you eat. At the same time it regulates the blood sugar levels in your body by releasing two hormones- Insulin and Glucagon. Both these hormones work in opposite directions. When the blood sugar levels are high in body Insulin is released to regulate. Similarly, when the blood sugar levels are low in the body Glucagon is released to regulate the same. Both the hormones are produced in ‘islet cells (islets of Langerhans)</p>
                        <p><strong>-   Insulin : </strong>As mentioned, it is a ‘peptide hormone’ and is produced by the islet cells in the pancreas. It controls the breakdown and synthesis of carbohydrates, fats and proteins in the body. When it is released in the blood it therefore absorbs the glucose and forms protein or fats in the liver or skeletal muscles. When the insulin levels are low in blood or they are ineffective, then the other hormone- Glucagon is released which promotes breakdown of fats from the body into blood stream.</p>
                        <p>If insulin is not produced in the body as per the desired quantity then a metabolic disorder happens and this leads to three major kind of DM.0</p>
                        <ol class="list-unstyled">
                            <li><strong>A.   When the Islet Cells are destroyed: </strong>Due to autoimmune reaction (Self-Destruction) beta cells of islet cells in Pancreas are destroyed and hence insulin cannot be produced. As a result the sugar levels in blood can no longer be checked and becomes very high. This type of DM is termed as – Type-1 DM. It can also be termed as – IDDM (insulin-dependent Diabetes Mellitus). This type of DM can be managed ONLY with Insulin administration from outside.

The most common cause of this type is sedentary lifestyle, or excessive stressor excessive body weight. This type is called- Type-2 DM or NIDDM (Non-Insulin dependent Diabetes Mellitus). Type-2 DM can be treated with medication with or without insulin.

                                                <p>Symptoms are usually the problems which are always short-term. On a long-term period, if untreated, these symptoms may result into complications. In case of DM, any type, there are serious long-term complications and it would be correct to term these complications as “RISKY OUTCOMES”!</p>

                                                    <li> Damage to blood vessels, hence higher chances of cardiovascular diseases. 75% of deaths in diabetics are due to Coronary Artery Disease.</li>
                                                    <li>  Small blood vessels in eye, with time, get damaged due to DM and distort the retina of eye, cause glaucoma, cataract, and many other eye problems.</li>
                                                    <li> Tiny blood vessels, glomeruli, in kidney get hardened and damage the tissue of Kidney. As a consequence, chronic kidney disease happens and might require dialysis or even kidney transplantation.</li>
                                                    <li>  Miniscule nerve endings get damaged due to prolonged, untreated, DM resulting into numbness, tingling, pain, in skin and foot. The muscles may loss the mass and can cause-muscle atrophy and eventually amputation of foot.</li>
                                                </ol>
                                                <p>It is been claimed that DM has no permanent cure and can only be managed by the following ways and means.

                                                <p>When allopath makes you hopeless and claims that DM is incurable, Ayurveda strongly believes that it can be completely treated.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>The 5000years old ancient Vedic Science follows the principle of ‘imbalance in doshas’. According to Ayurveda the body is healthiest when there are no imbalance in Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Ayurveda states that Type 1 DM is imbalance of Vata dosha. Type 2 DM is an excess of the Kapha. Hence, bringing the balance back can treat DM. It also states that there are 24 kinds of DM of which four are caused by Vata Dosha, six are caused by Pitta Dosha, and 10 are caused by Kapha Dosha.

                                                <p>Ayurveda follows a ‘Multipronged Approach’ while treating DM.</p>

                                                    <li class="mt-2">Diet Moderations: Keeping in mind that a healthy and timely diet is the first step in the treatment it is advised to reduce intake of sugar and simple carbohydrates. Protein intake is also reduced as high intake can put pressure on Kidneys. As the pancreas does not produce enough digestive enzymes, fat intake is also controlled. It is suggested to eat lots of fresh vegetables, orange, lemon, bitter fruits, and herbs.</li>
                                                    <li class="mt-2">Panchakarma: Panchakarma therapy, which includes herbal massages, herbal steam sauna and fasting are done to detoxify the body impurities.</li>
                                                    <li class="mt-2">Exercise and Yoga: Emphasis is kept on physical exercise, breathing exercise and Yoga.</li>
                                                    <li class="mt-2">Herbal Medicine: The uses of herbal medicines, which do not have any side-effects, are used to treat DM. The following ingredients are used as remedies- Shilajit, Gudmar Turmeric, Neem, Amalaki, Guggul, and Arjuna. Bitter Guard, Fenugreek, Musta, Triphala, Ajwain, and Haldi are predominantly used as medicines to treat DM.</li>
